# Why do we need to Analyze Energy Data

* **Buildings** account for **a large proportion of energy usage**. Commoercial and residential building combined account for 41% of national eregy usage in US [1].
* In order to meet the increasing energy sustainability standards, ‘smart’ buildings are instrumented with sophisticated **sensors for fine-grained energy monitoring** [2].
* **Analyzing smart meter data** in order to identify energy wastage can allow us to use energy more efficiently and economically. Also it is an important enabler for recovering the installation cost of sensing infrastructure [2].
* We propose a method for analysing energy data from smart-buildings to make **clusters**, which are grouped with **similar patterns** and indentiy **abnormal ernergy usage events**.
